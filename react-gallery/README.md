## Overview

### The challenge

In this project, I have created a JSON file to store all of my projects object informations.

I also used Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

I used Pug Templates, Node.js and Express to:

- Used `npm start` to start the server
- Import the required dependencies
- Link the JSON with the Pug templates
- Set up routes to handle requests
- Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS and Images
- Handle errors (404's, 500's)
- Set up a Express Server to serve the project

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to give thanks to the Student Success Mentors with Team Treehouse, the other students in their Slack channel and my friends on Discord that helped me along the way. Without everyone's support, I'd still be figuring out how to center a <div>

Finally, I'd like to acknowledge Voice Chat 3 in #100Devs for assisting me with the project.
